// Given an array of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.
// The input arrayOfInts will always have at least three integers.

// Pseudocode
// We have an array of 3+ ints
// want to find highest product 
// iterate over starting at three, i === 2
// track first three numbers
// as we do we want to check if the next number is bigger than any of our current numbers
// if so replace lowest with new number
// repeat until end
